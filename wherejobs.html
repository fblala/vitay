      <h1 class="findjob">Finding Jobs</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="fj">
      <p class="fj1"> The first step in your job getting journey is to find the right job for you. With the ever growing job market it is hard to see exactly which jobs are available. Listed below are ways to find jobs to make sure that you are able to land the job of your dreams.</p>
        <h1 class="fj2"><u>10 Best places to find a job</u></h1>
<h1 class="fj3"><strong>1. Company websites</strong></h1>
<p class="fj4"> <img src="images/writing.jpg" class="fjimage"alt="pic">Virtually every company has a section on its site for employer branding (telling you what a great place it is to work for and why) and specific jobs it is seeking to fill. Typically, they encourage you to apply directly online.
What companies don't necessarily say is that this part of their site either takes you outside the site or to a page that its applicant tracking system vendor mocked up to look like the company site.</p>
<h1 class="fj3"><strong>2. Traditional Job Boards</strong></h1>
<p class="fj4"> n the early days of the Internet, there were lots of job boards, but they've since been merged and otherwise winnowed down. The two giants remain CareerBuilder and Monster.</p>
<h1 class="fj3"><strong>3. Specialty Job Boards</strong></h1>
<p class="fj4"> There are many niche job boards tailored to serve only a single industry, skill set or professional group. A few examples: Medzilla for the pharmaceutical and biotech industries; CollegeRecruiter for recent grads looking for entry-level positions; and Dice for IT and software engineering positions. Also, DiversityJobs focuses on positions for minority groups. The list goes on and on!</p>
<h1 class="fj3"><strong>4. Professional Organization Sites</strong></h1>
<p class="fj4"> Many professional organizations host their own job boards for the exclusive use of their members. Examples include the American Institute of CPAs and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). And there are many more!</p>
<h1 class="fj3"><strong>5. LinkedIn</strong></h1>
<p class="fj4"> One could legitimately include LinkedIn's main Jobs tab among the giants, given that any recruiter or company can pay to list a job they are seeking to fill. Yet, LinkedIn goes beyond job-searching functions with its social features that enable you to see which of your connections works at target companies</p>
<h1 class="fj3"><strong>6. Aggregators</strong></h1>
<p class="fj4"> Sites such as Indeed and SimplyHired provide employer- and recruiter-paid ads, but they also go well beyond by scraping the Internet and reposting millions of jobs they find on all kinds of sites.</p>
<h1 class="fj3"><strong>7. Google and Yahoo Groups</strong></h1>
<p class="fj4"> Both Google and Yahoo have their own groups. You can often find a group dedicated to your area of interest or geography with positions listed.

</p>
<h1 class="fj3"><strong>8. Facebook</strong></h1>
<p class="fj4"> Facebook recently announced that it has indexed 2 trillion prior public posts and made them searchable by anyone. While this function is likely to raise some controversy and privacy concerns, it will have a myriad of uses, including those for job hunters.</p>
<h1 class="fj3"><strong>9. College Alumni Groups</strong></h1>
<p class="fj4"> In order to retain the loyalty of alumni and entice prospective students, most colleges offer career service help of one sort or another to alumni. Often, this includes an online listing of job vacancies.</p>
<h1 class="fj3"><strong>10: Twitter</strong></h1>
<p class="fj4">  One of the most overlooked but right-in-front-of-you sites for job postings is Twitter. Companies and recruiters often tweet out their most recent or challenging jobs to fill, along with links to full descriptions and instructions for how to apply. Applications like Tweetmyjobs send alerts to you when you sign up and tell it what you're interested in receiving.</p>
