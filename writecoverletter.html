    <div class="fj">
      <p class="fj1"><img src="images/writing.jpg" class="fjimage"alt="pic">A cover letter is a single-page letter that should be part of any job application.
The only time a cover letter shouldn't be included is when a job ad clearly says not to include one. At all other times you should include a cover letter. The Cover Letter usually descrbes your strongest qualities and traits and highlights why you want the job</p>
<h1 class="fj2"><strong>A cover letter needs to:</strong></h1>
<p class="fj4">&#9679; introduce you<br>
&#9679; mention the job (or kind of job) you're applying for (or looking for) <br>
&#9679; match your skills and experiences with the skills and experiences required by the job <br>
&#9679; encourage the reader to read your resume <br>
&#9679; finish with a call to action (for example, requesting an interview or asking to meet).<br></p>
<h1 class="fj2"><strong>How long should a cover letter be?</strong></h1>
<p class="fj4">A cover letter shouldn't be more than one page. It's only meant to be a summary of the information you put in your resume, so remember to keep things short.</p>
<h1 class="fj2"><strong>Matching your cover letter to the job</strong></h1>
<p class="fj4">You should never use the same cover letter for different job applications. Your cover letter needs to show that you know what the job involves and what the organisation is looking for. </p>
<h1 class="fj2"><strong>1. Find out who to address it to</strong></h1>
<p class="fj4">Try not to address your letter "To Whom It May Concern" if you can. Finding out who to address your application to takes a little bit of effort, but it's worth it.
If you found the job in an ad, the ad will probably name a person to send the application to. If not, contact the employer or advertiser and ask who to send the application to. It's best to call if you can, but you can also email them if you don't have a contact phone number for them.
If you manage to find out the person's name, don't use their first name. Use either "Mr." or "Ms." and their last name instead.</p>
<h1 class="fj2"><strong>2. Find out more about the job</strong></h1>
<p class="fj4">When finding out who to address your application to, you could also try to contact that person so you can ask questions that can help you match your cover letter (and resume) to the job.
Questions you could ask include:<br>
&#9679; Does the job involve working as part of a team?<br>
&#9679; Who would I be reporting to if I got the job? <br>
&#9679; Can you tell me more about the kind of people you're looking for?<br>
&#9679; Is there a position description I can look at (only ask this if the job ad didn't mention a position description)?<br>
 The answers to these questions can give you some ideas for things to mention in your cover letter.</p>
<h1 class="fj2"><strong>3. Find out more about the company</strong></h1>
<p class="fj4">Finding out more about a company is another good way to work out how to tailor your cover letter. Here are some tips:<br>
&#9679; If you know the name of the company, look for information online.<br>
&#9679; If the company has a website, visit it (especially their About Us page).<br>
&#9679; If the company name isn't in the ad, call the recruitment agency or advertiser and ask who the employer is. </p>
<h1 class="fj2"><strong>What you should include in your cover letter</strong></h1>
<p class="fj4">Here's a list of things you should include in your cover letter.</p>
<h1 class="fj2"><strong>Your name and contact details</strong></h1>
<p class="fj4">Put your name and contact details at the top of your cover letter. You don't have to give your postal address, but you do need to include your email and phone number.
Make sure you'll be able to answer the number you give. Don't give your landline number if you're not going to be home to answer it.
Your email address should create a professional impression. Don't use an email address like yolo@zapbangpowdude.co.uk.
If you don't have a professional email address, you can make one with a free email provider. Make it simple - something like your first name and your last name is a good way to go.</p>
<h1 class="fj2"><strong>Their name and contact details</strong></h1>
<p class="fj4">Under your own name and contact details you should include:<br>
&#9679; the name of the person you're writing to <br>
&#9679; their position or the name of their company <br>
&#9679; their contact details.<br>
&#9679; If you're having trouble finding this information you can call the company to ask who you should address your application to.
You can also use "To Whom It May Concern", but try to only use this as a last resort.</p>
<h1 class="fj2"><strong>The name of the job you're going for</strong></h1>
<p class="fj4">At the start of your cover letter you need to explain which job you're applying for.
You can either do this on a line by itself (for example, "Re: Application for Stock Controller position") or in the opening paragraph (for example, "I am writing to apply for the recently advertised Stock Controller position.")</p>
<h1 class="fj2"><strong>A list of your relevant skills</strong></h1>
<p class="fj4">Your letter should include a brief summary that matches your skills and experiences to the job description. A short bullet-pointed list is fine.
If you're answering a job ad, either the ad or the position description may provide a list of skills and experiences that are essential for doing the job. It may also provide a list of "desirable" skills and experience. Your cover letter needs to respond to all of the items on the "essential" list and as many items as possible on the "desirable" list in as short a way as possible.
Remember that if you say you have a skill or experience, you need to show how you've used it or how you got it (for example, if you say you've got child-minding skills, mention some jobs where you've used them).</p>
<h1 class="fj2"><strong>A summary of why you're right for the job</strong></h1>
<p class="fj4">After listing your skills and experience you should explain why these mean you're suited to the job (for example, "The combination of my interest in AFL and my experience with book-keeping makes me ideally suited for this job.")
To do this you need to be as specific as you can about your skills and qualities and how they match the job or organisation's needs.</p>
