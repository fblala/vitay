      <h1 class="findjob">Application Forms</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="fj">
      <p class="fj1"> Many employers require all applicants for employment, regardless of the job they apply for, to complete a job application form. You may be asked to submit a job application even if you have applied for a position with a resume and cover letter. This way the employer will have consistent data on file for all applicants.
A signed (paper or electronically) application for employment also serves as your verification that the information you have listed on the application is true.
Providing inaccurate information can be grounds for termination of consideration for hiring or of termination of employment if the erroneous information is discovered after the individual is hired.</p>
<h1 class="fj3"><strong>The Purpose of a Job Application Form</strong></h1>
<p class="fj4"> <img src="images/writing.jpg" class="fjimage"alt="pic">What is a job application form and when is it used? Job application forms (also called “employment forms”) are part of the formal hiring process companies sometimes use in order to ensure that they have gathered comprehensive, accurate data from all applicants. These forms often request certain information that is not always included on resumes and CVs, such as professional or personal references, the names of former supervisors, and / or a complete educational background. If you decide to submit your resume as a supplement to the job application form, cross-check it with your application to ensure there are no discrepancies.</p>
<h1 class="fj3"><strong>Review Your Employment History</strong></h1>
<p class="fj4">You'll need your resume (or a list of your employment and education history) to make sure that you're listing the correct dates of employment, job titles, and education. Your resume should match the job application perfectly because discrepancies will be noticed. </p>
<h1 class="fj3"><strong>Download a Sample Job Application.</strong></h1>
<p class="fj4"> Download a job application sample and practice filling it out. That way you can be sure that you have all the necessary information, in advance.</p>
<h1 class="fj3"><strong>Ask for an Application</strong></h1>
<p class="fj4"> If you're applying for a position in-person, ask for a job application, then take it home with you to complete. You can take your time filling it out so it will be neat and tidy, as well as accurate when you return to drop it off.</p>
<h1 class="fj3"><strong>Applying In-Person</strong></h1>
<p class="fj4">When you stop by, to pick up or drop off a job application, be sure you're dressed appropriately. You may end up speaking to the hiring manager and it's important to look professional, just in case you get an on-the-spot interview. </p>
<h1 class="fj3"><strong>In-Person Job Application Checklist</strong></h1>
<p class="fj4">If you review an in-person job application list beforehand, you'll ensure not making any blatant errors during the interview process. </p>
<h1 class="fj3"><strong>Online Job Applications</strong></h1>
<p class="fj4"> Job applications for many companies are often available online. For example, a WalMart Employment Application can be completed online and the same holds true for many other large national employers. In fact, some employers no longer accept paper applications and applicants are required to apply on the company web site or the site where the company listed the job openings.</p>
<h1 class="fj3"><strong>Follow the Instructions</strong></h1>
<p class="fj4"> Explicitly follow the instructions when completing both online and paper job applications. The slightest error could knock your application out of the running before an employer even gets a chance to look at your application. You might also want to check the company website, or the fine print on the job application form, to verify you've followed the directions as instructed.</p>
<h1 class="fj3"><strong>Review Before You Submit</strong></h1>
<p class="fj4"> Thoroughly read the instructions for applying for employment before you click the submit button (or hand in your application). Make sure every field is filled in. Some companies refuse to accept an incomplete application.</p>
<h1 class="fj3"><strong>Be Prepared to Take a Test</strong></h1>
<p class="fj4"> Some companies test applicants for employment in order to determine if the candidate is a good match for the job. Companies who conduct pre-employment tests (such as talent assessments) are seeking applicants that match their very specific hiring criteria. Being prepared for employment tests will help you respond better to employment-related questions.</p>
<h1 class="fj3"><strong>Know What's Included</strong></h1>
<p class="fj4"> The list below includes all the information you need to complete an application for employment.  </p>

<h1 class="fj3"><strong>Types of Job Applications.</strong></h1>
<p class="fj4"> If you’re looking for a job, how will you apply? It depends on the employer. A job application can be completed in several ways.
There are online job applications, typically completed at an employer’s website, at a hiring kiosk in a store or business, or on a mobile device using an app. In some cases, simply submitting a resume and cover letter online will be considered your application; you will not always be required to fill in the fields of a digital application form. In many cases, though, digital applications will require that you input your data directly into their system (frequently providing you the option to attach copies of your resume and cover letter as well)<h1 class="fj3"><strong>Online Job Applications</strong></h1>
<p class="fj4"> There are thousands of sites where you can post your resume online and complete an online job application. Sometimes you can apply online on job boards like Monster.com or job search engines like Indeed.com. Other times, you can apply directly on the company’s website.</p>
<h1 class="fj3"><strong>In-Person Job Applications
</strong></h1>
<p class="fj4"> Many companies, especially retail and hospitality employers, expect applicants to apply in person. It's not as complicated as applying online, but you will need to be prepared to apply and maybe even interview on the spot.</p>
