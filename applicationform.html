    <div class="fj">
      <p class="fj1"> Many employers require all applicants for employment, regardless of the job they apply for, to complete a job application form. You may be asked to submit a job application even if you have applied for a position with a resume and cover letter. This way the employer will have consistent data on file for all applicants.
A signed (paper or electronically) application for employment also serves as your verification that the information you have listed on the application is true.
Providing inaccurate information can be grounds for termination of consideration for hiring or of termination of employment if the erroneous information is discovered after the individual is hired.</p>

<h1 class="fj3"><strong>The Purpose of a Job Application Form</strong></h1>
<p class="fj4"> <img src="images/writing.jpg" class="fjimage"alt="pic">What is a job application form and when is it used? Job application forms (also called “employment forms”) are part of the formal hiring process companies sometimes use in order to ensure that they have gathered comprehensive, accurate data from all applicants. These forms often request certain information that is not always included on resumes and CVs, such as professional or personal references, the names of former supervisors, and / or a complete educational background. If you decide to submit your resume as a supplement to the job application form, cross-check it with your application to ensure there are no discrepancies.</p>

<h1 class="fj3"><strong>Types of Job Applications.</strong></h1>
<p class="fj4"> If you’re looking for a job, how will you apply? It depends on the employer. A job application can be completed in several ways.
There are online job applications, typically completed at an employer’s website, at a hiring kiosk in a store or business, or on a mobile device using an app. In some cases, simply submitting a resume and cover letter online will be considered your application; you will not always be required to fill in the fields of a digital application form. In many cases, though, digital applications will require that you input your data directly into their system (frequently providing you the option to attach copies of your resume and cover letter as well)<h1 class="fj3"><strong>Online Job Applications</strong></h1>
<p class="fj4"> There are thousands of sites where you can post your resume online and complete an online job application. Sometimes you can apply online on job boards like Monster.com or job search engines like Indeed.com. Other times, you can apply directly on the company’s website.</p>
<h1 class="fj3"><strong>In-Person Job Applications
</strong></h1>
<p class="fj4"> Many companies, especially retail and hospitality employers, expect applicants to apply in person. It's not as complicated as applying online, but you will need to be prepared to apply and maybe even interview on the spot.</p>
